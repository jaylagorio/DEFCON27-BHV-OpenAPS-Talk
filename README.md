Abstract: Managing diabetes revolves around stagnated tech from the 80s and 90s. Hackers took their lives into their hands by augmenting inadequate products after market.

Replacing human intervention with technology betters quality of life. See what happens when hackers decide theyâ€™re not waiting around for government and the MedTech industry to do better.
